**What’s new vs v2**
- Direction arrow on the route (points toward destination)
- Always-visible compass in the top-right (N/E/S/W + red north marker)
- More detailed route text in the status bar (distance + direction + instruction)

## How to Run (IntelliJ)
1. Open this folder in IntelliJ IDEA (File → Open)
2. Ensure Project SDK = **JDK 17+**
3. Run `Main.main()`

## How to Use
- Type a destination (e.g., "Engineering", "Student Center", "Tuttleman", "Tyler") and click **Go**
- The red line shows the route from **Library** to your destination
- Look for the **red triangle** on the route (points to the destination)
- See the **compass** (top-right) and **scale bar ≈100m** (bottom-right)
- Click **Set 5s Reminder** to simulate a class reminder
